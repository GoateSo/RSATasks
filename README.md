## Disclaimers: 
- Do not cheat or ask for help, the purpose of these challenges is to filter out beginners from the tiered channels to reduce channel noise.
- Cheaters will be disqualified, and those who fail to appear competent enough to be in the tiered channels will be removed from the channel.
- You will be required to submit your solution.

## Additional information:
- each challenge consists of 
   - problem, a lua file which lays out the directions, inputs, desired outputs, as well as giving an explained example, a solution template, and a testing template for a challenge
   - testgen, a lua file which generates an array of inputs for the challenge
   - examples, a file which gives additional examples of inputs and outputs
