# RSA Questions Tasks

tasks to determine admission into `#questions-tier-2`


## Disclaimers: 
- Do not cheat or ask for help, the purpose of these tasks is to filter out beginners from the tiered channels to reduce channel noise.
- Cheaters will be disqualified, and those who fail to appear competent enough to be in the tiered channels will be removed from the channel.
- You will be required to submit your solution.
- **solutions have to fulfill the input and output requirements of the task**
- if a problem gives an array as input, **DO NOT MODIFY IT** unless explicitly told to do so

## Additional information:
- each task consists of 
   - problem, a lua file which lays out the directions, inputs, desired outputs, as well as giving an explained example, a solution template, and a testing template for a task
   - testgen, a lua file which generates an array of inputs for the task as well as providing a list of concrete examples to test against
   - examples, a file which gives additional examples of inputs and outputs
- to submit a solution, Dm an online moderator on discord with your solution as a lua file, code block, a pastebin, or any similar website thereof (not as an image or a roblox place file)
- for any issue with any of the test cases/ generated tests you may have found, please also DM me about it
